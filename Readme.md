# Mac Reference
Bunch of info, tools and other tiny stuff I came across while switching to MacBook Pro M1.

## HomeBrew
HomeBrew is the linux like package manager for Mac OS.
https://docs.brew.sh/

Works well, haven't had any issues setting it up or using it.

## Installing Java
To install Java, use homebrew.

For Java 8 :
```brew install temurin8```

For Java 11 :
```brew install temurin11```

## Setting up React Native
Amazing article by David J Harding: [Here](https://medium.com/@davidjasonharding/developing-a-react-native-app-on-an-m1-mac-without-rosetta-29fcc7314d70)

Additionally :
yarn : ```brew install yarn```

!Important! Use ```cocaopods``` from homebrew and not gem : ```brew install cocoapods```
